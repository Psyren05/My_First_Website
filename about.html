        <div class="section1">Basil's Rescue has been running since 1996 and has taken in, rehabilitated, and rehomed hundreds of unwanted reptiles. Lack of 
            funds spawned an expansion to include reptile events for schools, fetes, birthday,s and other groups in 2008. This is aimed at educating children and others 
            about reptiles and other exotic animals. We are liability insured for 5m, hold a performing animals license and pet shop license as well as CRB checked. We offer 
            local schools anything from a one-hour visit to one class or a workshop for the day in a central area.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our summer fetes, fairs, and Christmas fairs certainly attract the crowds. If your think your child’s school may want a visit get in contact soon. For birthdays or 
            other parties with a more exotic feel, we can do hour handling sessions for afternoon shows with a larger amount of animals for the afternoon for 2 or more experienced 
            handlers.</p>
